# Market Basket Analysis  
_A practical implementation of market-basket / association rule mining for transaction data_

## Functionality  
This repository provides a structured workflow for mining transactional (basket) data, identifying frequent itemsets, deriving association rules, and generating actionable insights for retail or e-commerce environments, and wraps it all in a convenient Streamlit interface.

## Features  
- Frequent itemset mining using standard algorithms (e.g., Apriori)  
- Association rule generation with metrics: support, confidence, lift  
- Filter and highlight high-impact rules for business decisions (cross-sell, bundling, layout)  
- Easy-to-customize thresholds and reporting outputs  
- Clean, documented Python code for data loading, processing, and result summarisation  

## Project Structure  
```

## Use Cases
- **Cross-sell & Bundling**: Identify which items are often purchased together to craft bundles or recommend additional items.

- **Product Placement**: Inform physical or on-site layout by grouping highly associated items.

- **Promotions & Marketing**: Target customers with likely-to-buy-together offers.

## ⚠️ Important Notes
The provided dataset is sample/illustrative only. For real-world deployment, ensure data cleanliness, privacy compliance, and sampling integrity.

Results depend on algorithm thresholds: low thresholds may produce many trivial rules; high thresholds may miss meaningful but less frequent patterns.

Interpretation matters: A high lift does not guarantee causation—use business context to validate.
